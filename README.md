# Toxic Tweet Dataset: NLP Problem #

The dataset has a collection of Tweets. Its labelled as Toxic-1, non toxic-0. NLP methods are applied to predict toxicity
of the tweets. Dataset is downloaded from the Kaggle Competition https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwiniyer176/toxic-tweets-dataset. All 
the credit to the original collectors.

## Problem Approach ##
1. *Convert the CSV file to the Panda Dataframe*
2. *Implement the **Bag of Words model with TF-IDF weighting***
4. *The following **Machine Learning Algorithms** are used for classification and prediction*
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Naive Bayes Model
   - KNN classifier
   - SVM
 #### For each of the above models, the following matrices are produced ####
   - Precision, Recall, F!-score
   - Confusion matrix
   - RoC AUC curve
